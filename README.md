# Blonks Game

Blonks is a simple game built using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. The objective of the game is to click on falling blocks before they reach the bottom of the window. The game keeps track of the player's points and health.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. **Download**: Download the latest release of the game from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/blonks/releases) page.

2. **Run the Game**: Once you have downloaded the executable (blonks.exe), simply double-click on it to start the game.

3. **Gameplay**: The game starts with a start screen. Click on the "Play" button to begin the game. During the game, click on the falling blocks to destroy them and earn points. Avoid missing blocks, as this will decrease your health. The game ends when your health reaches zero.
